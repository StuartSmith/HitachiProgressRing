Hitachi Progress Ring
================

This is a sample application created from the example on Jerry Nixons blog on how to create a progress ring. It is designed using the Hitachi Logo on 8/27 at the So Cal Azure Users Group in Orange County I saw a presentation on the Hitachi Play book application.A windows 8 application used to keep a register of projects that Hitachi has done. Since the guys at Hitachi do not get anything back from giving such presentation I though it might be nice to see if I could create a custom progress ring control for them. I am not sure if they will use it or not... but it is pretty cool
